    <h1>Food</h1>
    <h2>Samosa</h2>
    <div class="container" style="width: 500px;">
        <p>This delicious option is a food that even those new to Indian cooking may have tried. As a fried dough pocket
            filled with delectable ingredients such as potato, onion, spices, and peas, samosas are often eaten as
            snacks in
            India. They are especially delicious when topped with sauces or chutneys.</p>
        <h2>Dal Soup</h2>
        <p>If you are a fan of soups, especially vegetarian ones, then you must try a bowl of dal. Dal is a comforting
            lentil-based soup that has been enhanced with herbs and spices. This soup feels warming in the winter months
            and cools during the summer, making it a popular choice with many soup lovers.</p>
        <h2>Curry</h2>
        <p>Curry is one of India’s most popular and well-known dishes. Tomato-based curries are known as the ultimate
            comfort food in India, and countries all over the world have adopted this opinion too. Curry spices are
            added to sizzling aromatics with other ingredients then added in, simmering together until the flavors merge
            in perfect harmony. Particularly delicious when topped over rice, there is a wide range of curry options to
            choose from, such as lamb, chicken, fish, or shrimp.</p>
        <h2>Tandoori Chicken</h2>
        <p>The only dish that’s probably more popular than this one would be chicken tikka, but even then it’s a close
            call. Tandoori chicken’s juicy consistency and mouthwatering spices make it a classic that never really goes
            out of style and always manages to make new fans with each serving.If you are new to Indian food, you may
            want to start with tandoori chicken for its universal appeal. The
            chicken is marinated in ingredients such as yogurt, ginger, garlic, and herbs, and then baked in a clay
            oven, creating a juicy and delicious flavor. Seafood lovers often opt for shrimp or fish tandoori, and those
            who are indecisive can find comfort in the tandoori mixed grill, combining chicken, shrimp, fish, and lamb
            into one savory meal.</p>
        <h2>Biryani</h2>
        <p>Every cuisine seems to have its own special rice dish―for Indians; this dish is biryani. The presentation of
            Biryani not only looks beautiful but has an addictive characteristic, earning it lots of devotees. Its
            blooming flavors and fluffy rice are enhanced by vegetables and sometimes meats, making it a favorite for
            vegetarians and meat lovers alike.</p>
